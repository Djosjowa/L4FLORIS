Required:
- Add DEL LUT generation for no IPC, 1P IPC and 2P IPC. This should be easy.
- Couple outputs from the new FLORIS model to inputs to the DEL LUT.
- Validate code.

Optional:
- Rewrite optimizeL4FLORIS.m to have a separate cost function file. 
  This should allow the use of off-the-shelf optimization algorithms 
  in MATLAB, instead of solely the implemented GT approach.
- Make more user-friendly..?

1. Set-up your preferences in LUTsettings.m.
2. Specify the desired filenames through "inflowFilename.m" (Note: needs work and adaption in internal codes)
3. Then generate wind fields using "generateWindFields.m"
4. Finally calculate DELs according to "calculateDELs.m"

You should find your new DEL look-up table in the "LUT_database" folder
